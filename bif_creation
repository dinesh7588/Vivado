**BEST SOLUTION**

It works!

Here's the recipe:

    Starting with a working PL design in Vivado...
    Added a block design IP with just a Zynq. The Zynq had its Quad SPI Flash enabled and most everything else disabled. 
    Instantiated the Block Design IP with nothing connected.
    After Synth & Imp, exported the Hardware (and .bit file) to SDK and then opened the SDK.
    Inside the SDK, added new app project using fsbl template. Made sure the fsbl project would run in the debugger then stopped the debugger before the next steps.
    In the SDK, used menu Xilinx Tools / Create Boot Image and created a .bif file. This .bif file had just two entries: [1] a (bootloader) entry that referenced the newly created fsbl .elf file built by the SDK and [2] the .bit file for the PL design built by Vivado. The output for this step is a .bin file that is downloaded to SPI flash.
    In the SDK, used menu Xilinx Tools / Program Flash, referencing the newly created .bin file, selecting a flash type of qspi_single. Offset was left blank. During programming, the PL stopped running on the board (as expected) and did not start running until the board was reset with a power cycle.
    Boot time was very fast - maybe less than 1 second.
